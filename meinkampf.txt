 Often we think the leader is the smartest person in the room, however this is rarely the case their is almost always some smarter than you or better than you at this or that, so it is important not to let your pride get in the way, but rather seek to learn from this individuals and better ourselves through them. 

 Proverbs 16:16 says, “How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.”
Proverbs 1:5 “Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,”
Proverbs 18:15 “An intelligent heart acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.”
This means that if you want to be a wise leader you should always be looking for ways to learn something new, and the best way to do that is to look for people who can teach you from experience.

 As the leader it is not your job to have every answer, there will be things you don’t know, and this is ok as long as you are strong enough to admit what you don’t and ask for help. The worst thing you can do as a leader is to pretend you have all the answers, and refuse counsel from others.

 As a leader you will make mistakes and you must learn from them, but there is almost always someone who has made that mistake before, so it is best to find these people and learn from their mistakes rather than having to make those mistakes yourself.

 Another example of this character trait can be found in Luke 2:41-52 41) Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. 42) When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. 43) After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. 44) Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. 45) When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. 46) After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 47) Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”
49) “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?” 50) But they did not understand what he was saying to them. 51) Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 52) And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. These verses show the importance of being a good leader and the reward, the final verse shows that those who take the time to learn from others, gain true wisdom and favor, because let's face it no one likes to work for a know it all. 
 A good leader should always be learning, growing and improving. The day you feel there is nothing left to learn is the day that pride and arrogance have taken root.
