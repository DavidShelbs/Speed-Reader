ON APRIL 1st, 1924, I began to serve my sentence of detention in the Fortress of
Landsberg am Lech, following the verdict of the Munich People's Court of that time.

After years of uninterrupted labour it was now possible for the first time to begin a
work which many had asked for and which I myself felt would be profitable for the
Movement. So I decided to devote two volumes to a description not only of the aims of
our Movement but also of its development. There is more to be learned from this than
from any purely doctrinaire treatise.
